# Uber Eats Data Analysis using SQL  

## **Database Schema Setup**  

This project involves analyzing Uber Eats data using SQL. The database consists of five main tables:  
- **customers** (stores customer details)  
- **restaurants** (stores restaurant details)  
- **orders** (stores customer orders)  
- **riders** (stores rider details)  
- **deliveries** (stores delivery status and assignments)
